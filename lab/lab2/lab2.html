    <p>I'm a QCC student. My major is Science and Nursing. </p>
    <p>I've been exposed to major science subjects like Chem, Bio, Math, Stat, and A&P excluding computer sciences. </p>
    <p>I took Statistics class last year and got amazed how codes work. So I'm here to learn about the basics of coding. </p>
    <p>If I will able to create a website, it will give me an opportunity to publish my medical reseach projects</p>
