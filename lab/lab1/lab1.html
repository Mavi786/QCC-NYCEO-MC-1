<p>I'm a QCC student. <br>My major is Sciences and Nursing. <br>I've been exposed to major science subjects like Chem, Bio, Math, Stat, A&P, and so on  excluding computer sciences. <br>I took Statistics class last year and got amazed how codes works. <br>So I'm here to learn about the basics of coding. <br>If I will able to create a website, it will give me an opportunity to publish my medical reseach projects</p>
